##

By using right algorithm we can reduce time complexity.

## Stack Overflow:

It happens when we use recursion but not a condition to come out of that function.

##

Anything you do with a recursion can be done using interatively (loop)

## Benefits and Disadvantages

DRY, Readability but Large Stack.

## When to use recursion?

We can use recursion with Data Structures, we dont know how deep they are and how mapy loops to go through.
We can use it in tree traversal, BFS and DFS search.

Every time you are using a tree or converting something into tree, consider recursion.
Devide and Conquer using recursion.

## When to use Recursion and when to use Loops?

Recursion - DRY, Redability [space complexity increases]
Loops - If having very less memory and can't afford using more space.
