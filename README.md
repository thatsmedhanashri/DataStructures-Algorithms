# Good code checklist

It works
Good use of data structures
Code re-use/ Do Not Repeat yourself
Modular - makes code more readable, maintainable and testable
Less than O(n^2). Avoid nested loops, 2 seperate loops are better than nested loops.
Low space complexity - Recursion can cause stack overflow, copying of large arrays may exceed memory of machine.

## Heurestics to ace the questions

Hash maps are usually the answer to improve Time Complexity
If it's a sorted array, use Binary tree to achive O(log N)
Divide and Conquer - devide data into smaller parts
Try sorting your input
Hash tables and precomputed information (i.e. sorted) are some of the best ways to optimize your code
Look at the Time vs Space tradeoff. Sometimes storing extra state in mempry can help the time.
SPace time tradeoffs: Hash Tables usually solve this a lot of the times. You use more space but it help to reduce time complexity.
