## Linear Data Structure

In a linear data structure, data elements are arranged in a linear order where each and every element is attached to its previous and next adjacent.
In linear data structure, data elements can be traversed in a single run only.
In a linear data structure, memory is not utilized in an efficient way.
Its examples are: array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.
Applications of linear data structures are mainly in application software development.
Linear data structures are useful for simple data storage and manipulation.

## Non Linear Data Structure

In a non-linear data structure, data elements are attached in hierarchically manner.
While in non-linear data structure, data elements canâ€™t be traversed in a single run only.
While in a non-linear data structure, memory is utilized in an efficient way.
While its examples are: trees and graphs.
Applications of non-linear data structures are in Artificial Intelligence and image processing.
Non-linear data structures are useful for representing complex relationships and data hierarchies, such as in social networks, file systems, or computer networks.
